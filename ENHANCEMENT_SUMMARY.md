## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
python3 comprehensive_enhanced_dal.py
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
from comprehensive_enhanced_dal import ComprehensiveEnhancedClassifier

classifier = ComprehensiveEnhancedClassifier(random_state=42)
classifier.load_and_preprocess_data()
classifier.split_data()
classifier.apply_feature_engineering(pca_components=512, k_best=300)
classifier.handle_class_imbalance()
# ... continue with training pipeline
```

## Model Selection Guidance

1. **For Maximum Performance**: Use the meta-ensemble (combines all models)
2. **For Speed**: Use enhanced neural network only
3. **For Interpretability**: Use random forest or logistic regression
4. **For Label Dependencies**: Use classifier chains or ensemble chains
